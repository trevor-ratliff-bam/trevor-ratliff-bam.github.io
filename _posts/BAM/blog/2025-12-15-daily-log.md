# full log:
# -6:30-  up, readied for day
# -7:15-  at work, closed out ai-play project, looked at email and teams, started looking at 423910
# @9:00-  stand-up
# -9:15-  continued work on 42391
# -1:00-  late lunch
# -2:00-  got the rest of the code removed for 423910.  Started looking for links to replace/fix for 423915, but couldn't find any.  So I ask Jeremy about it and there were a few things he pointed out to me.
#   - sidetracked trying vibe coding with continue as compared to copilot, much rougher of an experience, but that may be due to the models I was using.  JosiQwen had issues with tool use in agent mode, josiDeep did better at that though - but overcomplicated what I thought would be a simple exercise.
# -4:30-  off work

## Log

Getting back up to speed on what I was doing last week.  After getting back into the groove I finished up the code removal for 423910, and started on looking for links that needed updating (423915).
