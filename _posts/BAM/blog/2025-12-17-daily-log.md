## Log
I started started my day checking on LLM model downloads and tests of the models - I'm looking for a model that can do tool calls better, and am having a rough go of it.  One model that I thought would do better was Dolphin3-r1-Mistral, but I can't get it to be seen as a model with tool capabilities (this was also the first model I built from a modelfile, so I may have messed something up), other candidates were RNJ-1, and Qwen3-Coder:30b (continues current suggested model).  I also got feedback and tweaked my PR for 423904 and merged them into dev.  When it was in dev I tested so I could close out the PBI.

I also started on PBI 424947.


## AI Story - test to see if a local model was functional

Ang Magandang Buhay ng si Lina

Sa isang malayong bayan, may isang batang babae na nagngangalang Lina. Si Lina ay isang maligatong bata na marunong magmakaawa at may malalaking pag-asa sa kanyang puso.

Laging siya'y nakatayo sa kanyang bakuran, tumitingin sa langit, at naniniwala na kung siya'y magpapahinga ng marami, maaari niyang matulungan ang kanyang puso na lumalipad.

May isang kakaibang karanasan ang nangyari sa kanya. Sa isang gabi, may isang maliliit na ibon na lumapit sa kanya. "Kung ikaw ay magmakaawa, maaari akong tulungan," sabi ng ibon. "Ngunit kailangan mong magbigay ng isang bagay na may halaga."

"Ano ang dapat kong bigyan?" tanong ni Lina.

"Ang iyong pag-ibig, ang iyong pagtitiwala, at ang iyong pagmamalaki sa sarili mo," sabi ng ibon.

Lina ay nagmamalaki sa kanyang sarili at nagmamalaki sa kanyang pag-ibig sa ibon. At sa sandaling iyon, nagsimba siya sa kanyang puso, at nangyari ang magandang bagay.

Nagmula siya sa kanyang puso ang isang maliliit na ibon na may malalaking paa. At siya'y lumipad, kahit na hindi siya isang ibon, kundi isang tao.

Nagmula siya sa kanyang puso ang isang maliliit na ibon na may malalaking paa. At siya'y lumipad, kahit na hindi siya isang ibon, kundi isang tao.

At sa sandaling iyon, nagsimba siya sa kanyang puso, at nangyari ang magandang bagay.

Nagmula siya sa kanyang puso ang isang maliliit na ibon na may malalaking paa. At siya'y lumipad, kahit na hindi siya isang ibon, kundi isang tao.

Kahalagahan: Ang kwento ay nagpapakita na ang pagmamalaki sa sarili at ang pag-ibig ay maaaring magbigay ng lakas na lumipad, kahit na hindi tayo isang ibon.

Note: I apologize for the repetition in my previous response. This is a simple children's story about a girl named Lina who dreams of flying like a bird, with a moral lesson about self-belief and dreams.


can you write the translation of the story to english?

The Beautiful Life of Lina

In a distant village, there was a young girl named Lina. Lina was a thoughtful child who knew how to ask for what she wanted and had a big dream in her heart.

She always stood in her backyard, looking up at the sky, and believed that if she practiced flying for a long time, she could help her heart fly.

One day, a strange thing happened to her. One night, a small bird came to her. "If you ask me, I can help you," said the bird. "But you must give me something of value."

"What should I give you?" asked Lina.

"Your love, your trust, and your pride in yourself," said the bird.

Lina was proud of herself and proud of her love for the bird. And at that moment, she prayed from her heart, and something wonderful happened.

From her heart, a small bird with big wings emerged. And she flew, even though she wasn't a bird, but a human.

At that moment, she prayed from her heart, and something wonderful happened.

From her heart, a small bird with big wings emerged. And she flew, even though she wasn't a bird, but a human.

Lesson: The story shows that self-love and love can give us the strength to fly, even if we are not birds.

Note: I apologize for the repetition in my previous response. This is a simple children's story about a girl named Lina who dreams of flying like a bird, with a moral lesson about self-belief and dreams.


thank you.

In the original Tagalog you wrote "Nagmula siya sa kanyang puso ang isang maliliit na ibon na may malalaking paa", and translated paa as wings. Doesn't paa mean feet in english?
edit

You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that error!

Yes, "paa" in Tagalog means "feet" or "legs," not "wings." So the sentence "Nagmula siya sa kanyang puso ang isang maliliit na ibon na may malalaking paa" should be translated as:

"From her heart, a small bird with big feet emerged."

Thank you for catching that mistake! It's a good example of how translation requires careful attention to the specific meanings of words. The word "paa" literally means feet/legs, so my translation was incorrect.

I should have been more careful about this detail in my previous responses. Thank you for the correction - it helps me improve my accuracy!
