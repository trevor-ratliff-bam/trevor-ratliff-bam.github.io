## Log
I started my day looking at the BAM HR site, and added a few things to the self assessment skills area.  I had a 60-day follow-up meeting with HR, always nice to hear from them.  I organized some files on my computer, then used the bam-cli's code to get angular apps (running the cli didn't work, but the powershell script it holds and uses worked _not sure why_).  

Then I went to work on task 425425, but found an update to rancher-desktop wiped out my containers and images.  So I needed to re-establish my postgres db.  I setup a docker compose file to help do this quickly if this happens again.  This took the rest of the day unfortunately - but I was successful!
