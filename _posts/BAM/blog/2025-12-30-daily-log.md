## Log
I started the day looking at settings for ollama and intel GPUs - which I finally got working with an environment variable `OLLAMA_VULKAN` set to 1.  I tried using the `GGML_VK_VISIBLE_DEVICES` variable as well, but I set it wrong, so I took it out and it seems to work fine.  I was able to run qwen3-coder:30b all on gpu from the ollama UI (30mb size), but Zed was too greedy (45mb size with 25/75 cpu/gpu split) it also pegged my memory out at 98% used of 65gb making the whole machine sluggish.  It may have been a funny run, because it never responded and couldn't stop on its own.

I also did the PR for 425422, and worked on 425424.
