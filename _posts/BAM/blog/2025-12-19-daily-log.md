## Log
Good morning, after learning a bit more about the AI developer tool Continue, I started finalizing the files I was going to remove in 424953.  We met as a team to go over some PRs together.

After that and when I finished removing files, I submitted a PR.  I then reviewed another PR for Craig.  My PR passed review and I tested the changes in dev, it passed so I closed the task.
