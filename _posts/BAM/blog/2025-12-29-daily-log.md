## Log
I started the day getting caught up on my emails and teams messages that I missed while on leave.  Then I started looking for a new task.  During stand-up a task was suggested and I worked on trying to figure that out.  The ticket was missing some detail to help me know where to look.  I asked if the team could help and Binh offered to talk.  He gave me good information on where to start poking and I made some progress.  Eventually I hit a snag and needed to ask more questions.  After lunch I talked with Binh again, we found a view that needed to change and he walked me through how BAM was handling the view migrations.
