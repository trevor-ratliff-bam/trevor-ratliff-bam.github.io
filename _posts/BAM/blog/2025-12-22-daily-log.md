## Log
Today was a lot of meetings, starting with the Internal sprint review, which lead to a couple of team bridge sessions to resolve things seen in the demo prior to code freeze.  I was assigned task 426064 to fix a breadcrumb link, which sounded simple at first, then I got into the code - and it wasn't quite as easy as hoped, but wasn't too difficult once I understood how they worked.
