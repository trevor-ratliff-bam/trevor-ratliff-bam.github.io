## Log
Good morning!  I tried keeping too many things in focus at once today, and wasn't as effective at any of it.  I did get my PR for 422875 merged into dev - but I still need to test in the dev environment.  I reviewed a PR - but someone finished the review before I did, but it was a good learning tool.  I also got the new angular Talent Marketplace app working locally (good for future efforts).
