## Log
I got started by setting up the git branches for work on 424947, and got a bit lost in trying to get my git-credential helper working.  I was looking at the WSL portion because I forgot the part that wasn't working was in a dev container.

I got back to 424953 after stand-up and was looking through what I thought I'd need to remove.  I asked a question of my team about some files.  Then due to the response had my research change course and I started a PR review on a related task that another team member had done.
