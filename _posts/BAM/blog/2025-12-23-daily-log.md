## Log
We were in the team chat pretty much all day today.  I didn't get much else done.  I tested and closed task 426064, and looked at a PR for task 426082.  The PR was moved to next sprint after figuring out the authentication changse were going to be a bit harder than anticipated.  I found out that BAM has an MCP server for copilot/dev instructions, so I spent the last of my day looking into that.
