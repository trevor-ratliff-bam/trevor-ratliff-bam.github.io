## Log
I got set up for getting my fingerprints collected for work.  I started looking at the hangfire email code for un/locking a person.  I finished up the PR for this task and am waiting on feedback.  

I picked up change 423904 with its tasks 423910 and 423915 which is to remove a duplicated feature for the Data Interface.  Then I left to get my fingerprints done, yay for new hire tasks.
