## Log
I got the day started with an internal sprint review for sprint 273.  Then I got back to addressing comments on my PR for task 422875.  I had a discussion with the team about the data flow for the unauthorized user information (same as locked user).  I was told BAM-OAuth is source of truth for this data, and I shouldn't have to look outside of the monolith code base to verify code is dead and ready for removal.
