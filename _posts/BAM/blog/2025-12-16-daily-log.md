## Log
Good morning, I started with getting a PR published, then I talked with a teammate about Outsystems work - getting a brief overview on module dependency processes.
I was able to adjust the links in Outsystems, the old system admin and the new system admin apps.  Once I get my PRs merged I should be done with 423904.
