## log
I continued my computer setup journey with trying to use the BAM cli to get the angular sites.  Currently if I run the `bam git get-angular` command it gets up to cloning 1 repo, then breaks.  When I ran the powershell script it uses, the script worked fine.  I'm not sure why the cli breaks.

I participated in a Weekly Discovery meeting where for the first time I was able to get some work tailored for me.  I'm glad I can finally get to some productive work after a long onboarding period.
