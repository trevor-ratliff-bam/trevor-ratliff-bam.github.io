## log

Today was mostly a day to work on my assigned task to help streamline our codebase.  There was also a collaboration meeting with the PAW team to go over some recent PRs.

I was able to get my code changes completed today for 422875.  I still need to get a PR and walk it through the process.

I learned what I was missing to be able to run myvector locally and link it to separately running angular modules.  I needed to build myvector in the `NoAngular` build config, then I could run the angular module using the following added debug profile:  
{% highlight json %}
{
  "name": "launch Chrome against localhost",
  "type": "chrome",
  "request": "launch",
  "preLaunchTask": "npm: start",
  "url": "http://localhost/myvector",
  "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
},
{% endhighlight %}
