## log
I tried to get local system running again today, but it didn't work ... so frustrating.  I could only get the my-vector/system-admin (new angular app) working if I was also running usaf-myvector in VS 2022.  Just running from IIS kept hitting "looping/redirect" issues where I'd loose my authorization cookies and have to log in again, but it wouldn't let me get to the correct places (due to redirect rules or base_url maybe???).  

At least I was able to get things to run again.
